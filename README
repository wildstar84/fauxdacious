NOTE:  You NO LONGER NEED to uninstall Audacious or any audacious packages,
ie. libaudcore, libaudgui, libaudtag, etc.  before installing Fauxdacious!
Both programs can now happily reside on the same system and root path.

NOTE (M$-Windows users):  You do NOT need to build Fauxdacious from scratch!  
Instead, just download and run the Fauxdacious Windows Easy-Installer and run 
it to install Fauxdacious with your mouse!:  
https://github.com/wildstar84/fauxdacious-windows-easyinstaller

How to build (generally only needed for non-Windows users):

(For additional general info, see:  http://redmine.audacious-media-player.org/boards/1/topics/788?r=1762#message-1762 - 
Building Audacious)

(For building on M$-Windows systems (if you insist), see:  https://github.com/wildstar84/fauxdacious/blob/master/contrib/win32/fauxdacious_buildnotes.htm

Install the following Dependencies:

sudo apt-get install git automake build-essential libasound2-dev \
libavformat-dev libbinio-dev libbs2b-dev libcddb2-dev libcdio-cdda-dev \
libcue-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libfaad-dev libflac-dev \
libfluidsynth-dev libgtk2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libjack-jackd2-dev \
liblircclient-dev libmms-dev libmodplug-dev libmp3lame-dev libmpg123-dev \
libneon27-gnutls-dev libnotify-dev libpulse-dev libsamplerate0-dev \
libsdl2-dev libsidplayfp-dev libsndfile1-dev libsoxr-dev libvorbis-dev \
libwavpack-dev libxml2-dev libswscale-dev

NOTE:  libgtk2.0-dev only needed for building for GTK-2 and libgtk-3-dev for GTK-3.

NOTE2:  If building the Qt version, you'll also need at least the following (which 
should also bring in their dependencies):

sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev qt5-qmake libglu-dev libvulkan-dev \
libxext-dev libqt5opengl5-dev libqt5x11extras5-dev

NOTE3:  If building for Qt6, you'll also / instead need:  qt6-base-dev, qt6-svg-dev

Please report any others it reports as missing when building, so I can make 
sure they're included here too!

Download and install from Github:

	cd /tmp
	mkdir fauxdacious
	mkdir fauxdacious-plugins
	git clone --single-branch https://github.com/wildstar84/fauxdacious.git fauxdacious
	git clone --single-branch https://github.com/wildstar84/fauxdacious-plugins.git fauxdacious-plugins

Build Fauxdacious:

	cd /tmp/fauxdacious
	./autogen.sh
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local [--enable-qt] --with-buildstamp=yyyymmdd
        #(yyyymmdd = year month day, ie. 20250123)
	make
	(sudo) make install

	sudo ldconfig

Build Fauxdacious Plugins:

	cd /tmp/fauxdacious-plugins
	./autogen.sh
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local [--enable-qt]
	make
	(sudo) make install

	sudo update-desktop-database
	sudo update-icon-caches /usr/share/icons/hicolor

Install the (optional but highly reccomended) Perl helper scripts 
(non-M$-Windows versions - The Windows EasyInstaller takes care of all this 
for M$-Windows users):

	sudo cp fauxdacious/contrib/Fauxdacious*.pl /usr/local/bin/
	sudo chmod 755 Fauxdacious*.pl
	Install prerequesite Perl modules (see FAQ #36 for details):
		File::Copy, HTML::Entities, HTML::Strip, HTTP::Request, HTTP::Cookies, 
		LWP::UserAgent, URI::Escape, StreamFinder, and LyricFinder.

Optional (copy your existing Audacious profile to Fauxdacious):  

	cd ~/.config; mkdir fauxdacious; cp -R audacious/. fauxdacious
	# This copies your previous default Audacious instance profile(s) to the
	# new (Fauxdacious) location.

Now run fauxdacious:

	fauxdacious &   #(GTK) -OR-     fauxdacious -Q &   #(Qt)

Fauxdacious should now start up.  Enjoy Fauxdacious!
Be sure to read the "FAQ" and "Changes" file, and the GIT commits for the 
latest Fauxdacious features, fixes, changes, and how to configure to take 
best advantage of them (many/most Fauxdacious extras are off by default)!
