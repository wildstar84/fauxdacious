    <p>
      Fauxdacious is an open source media player.  A fork of Audacious,
      Fauxdacious plays your music, videos, CDs and DVDs how you want, without
      stealing away your computer's resources from other tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drag and drop folders and individual song files, search for artists and
      albums in your entire music library, or create and edit your own custom
      playlists. Listen to CDs or stream music from the Internet.  Tweak the
      sound with the graphical equalizer or experiment with LADSPA
      effects. Enjoy the modern GTK or Qt-themed interfaces or change things
      up with Winamp Classic skins. Use the plugins included with Fauxdacious
      to fetch lyrics and album-art covers for your music, to set an alarm in
      the morning, and more.
