Long-time Audacious users should find Fauxdacious a complete drop-in replacement for Audacious.  However, since it is now a completely separate program, Audacious users can install and try out Fauxdacious without any risk to their existing Audacious installation or configuration.  If you wish to copy your existing Audacious configuration for starters in Fauxdacious, simply:  (NOTE:  If you've started Fauxdacious at least once, then ~/.config/fauxdacious/ will already exist and you won't need to create it!)</span></td>

<tr>
<td align="justify" valign="top" width="100%"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;font-size:19px;font-weight:normal;">Fauxdacious has it's roots back around 2011 when I (the author) began experimenting with a few "hacks" to add some extra command-line options and tools to Audacious version 1.6 or so, which the Audacious team was not interested in including.  The real forkoff came in 2015 with Audacious v3.6 when I created a video-playing option for the ffmpeg plugin.  I felt that since Audacious included "visualization plugins" already, why not include one for actually displaying the video part of audio streams that contained video?  After much work to add video play, I submitted the patched plugin to Audacious as a patch, but the Audacious team made it clear that they were not interested in supporting / maintaining that feature.  They suggested using a video player such as VLC.  I, however, really like Audacious and it's audiophileish sound-improving effects plugins and Winamp Skins interface, much preferring Audacious to VLC, and preferred having a single "go-to" media player for playing all my media.  Therefore I decided to simply "fork" the code and maintain a separate Audacious branch that supported this along with it's growing list of feature patches, because I felt that other Audacious-lovers would also be interested in these new features.  I've also created new logos and and changed the branding to the new name "Fauxdacious".  I came up with this name by altering the name "Audacious" to have the French "Faux" like "Faux Pas" meaning "fake" or "not exactly the real thing" and liked the way it sounded!  It's pronounced either "Faw-d`&#230;-shuhs" (rhiming with Audacious) or "F&#333;-d`&#230;-shuhs".  I made the logo by using the basic "audacious" logo but adding a row of speakers instead of bubbles, a base ("F" cleff for the "F", and the slightly-rocked "X" from the default XMMS skin's logo in the lower right.  I made a separate logo for the Windows version replacing the rocked "X" with a rocked "MS-Windows flag logo" that contains a swirled "X".  The round icon replaces the "a" in a bubble with the aformentioned base-cleft "F".  NOTE:  I created this name and these logos and reserve all implied copyright rights to them as unique trademarks of "Fauxdacious"(tm).  They are not to be used for any other purpose without my explicit written permission.  The software code, a derived work, however is fully open-source" subject to the BSD license (the same license that Audacious uses) and you are free to use, modify and re-release your changes subject to those terms (so long as you change the name and logos).</span></td>

Then, depending on your Linux system, you will likely also need to install some additional Perl modules from CPAN (https://www.cpan.org), which is usually not difficult to do.  The additional modules (which should be installed by the Perl package manager when you install "StreamFinder") are:  "StreamFinder", "LWP::Simple", "LWP::UserAgent", and "URI::Escape".  NOTE:  You will also need to install either the "youtube-dl" package for your distro or download and install it yourself.  "youtube-dl" is a separate program that handles the actual "downloading" of the video.  In the case of Fauxdacious, the video is not actually downloaded to a file on your hard disk, but simply translated into a playable stream and metadata and a "cover-art" image is downloaded.  NOTE:  You will also need to go to [Settings].[Advanced], and add the full path and filename of the helper script you just copied over into the "URL-helper program?" field, and toogle the "Allow URL-helper:" dropdown to something other than "Never" ("Urls NOT in playlists" is reccomended except when you intend to load several Youtube-videos at once in a playlist, which can cause playlists with URLs to load VERY SLOWLY).

You can also change the default filename from "/tmp/lastvideo" to whatever you like.  Then, play the video all the way through but don't let Fauxdacious advance to another video entry, but stop play (An easy and handy way to do this is drag your Youtube video to the bottom of your playlist and turn [Repeat] OFF), then go back to [Settings].[Plugins].[Input tab].[FFmpeg Plugin], uncheck the "Record" box (to prevent overwriting), then you have the video in the file you chose (default "/tmp/lastvideo"), which you'll likely want to move and rename to something with a proper extension, ie. ".m4a" usually works.  
After moving the saved video file to wherever you want it to permanently reside, if you want to save the metadata and cover-art file, you will need to edit both ~/.config/fauxdacious/tmp_tag_data and either ~/.config/fauxdacious/user_tag_data OR &lt;path to saved video file&gt;/user_tag_data.tag, and MOVE the lines starting with [https://r6---sn-q4fl6n7s.googlevideo...] and ending with a blank line from the "tmp_tag_data" file to one of the other file you opened.  Then change the "https://r6---sn-q4fl6n7s.googlevideo..." part to "file://&lt;path to your saved video file&gt;".  Save both files.  You can also move the cover-art image to there as well and edit the "Comment=" line to it's new location.  This saves your tag data and cover-art image for the new video file.</span></td>

If you have trouble playing a specific DVD, you can adjust the settings in [Settings].[Plugins].[Input tab].[DVD Plugin].  If your dvd device is unusual, ie. something other than "/dev/dvd", change this box.  Make sure the "Play video stream in popup window..." box is checked (unless you just want audio).  You'll probably want the "Highlight menu buttons" box checked.  To avoid clutter in your playlist, most users will want "Only Title Track in Playlist" checked.  If the DVD menu doesn't seem to work (some DVDs just don't), you may want to also either check the "Only 1st track in Playlist" and/or the "Only Longest Track in Playlist" box, which is usually just the main feature movie.  If none of the "Only..." boxes are checked, each "track" file on the DVD will appear in the playlist (giving it a cluttered appearance, and is not usually very useful).  

"Continue at end of menus" and "Skip Menus" should only be checked if a DVD's menus don't work otherwise, as this can cause some DVDs to crash Fauxdacious.  It's also helpful to have one or the other checked (experiment) if just playing audio (in which case there's no way for the user to interact with the DVD menus).

Check the box for "Allow Custom Tag-files" to allow usage of custom tag files which you can either create manually and/or use the save Song Info box to create and save metadata for the DVD tracks.  The custom tag file for a DVD will be "~/.config/fauxdacious[_instancename]/DVD_TITLE.tag".

NOTE:  This is also true for audio-CDs ("~/.config/fauxdacious[_instancename]/DISK-ID.tag"), except audio-CDs can also fetch metadata for individual tracks from freedb.com, or musicbrainz.com using the cover-art "helper" script (mentioned next paragraph below) and create the custom tag file (along with downloading any cover-art image) for you the first time you play the CD.

To set custom equalizer presets for a specific song, stream, or CD / DVD disk, first start playing it.  Then open up the Equalizer window and make sure both the [Auto] and [Equalizer] buttons (or checkboxes, depending on interface) are selected.  Then press the [Preset(s)] button.  A dialog window will pop up.  There are three additional checkboxes on this window:  "Use entry's local dir..." specifies try to save the presets in the same directory as the song file / cue-sheet file is in (only applicable if the song is a local file, not a disk or url).  Otherwise, the custom presets will be saved in the ~/.config/fauxdacious[_instancename]/ directory.  The "Exclude arg. lists from urls..." box only applies to URLs.  Checking this removes the "?..." crap off of the URL before naming the custom preset file.  This is useful if one doesn't want to create long nasty preset file names for every possible URL on the site, but can limit customization.  Experiment as ymmv.  Uncheck the "Save Effects..." checkbox if you only want to save equalizer presets for the song and not the current list of Effects plugins being used.

Next, choose [Export], then [Preset File] from the menu.  A window should pop up with the proper name for the custom preset file filled in and the current directory set to either the local file's path or ~/.config/fauxdacious[_instancename]/ directory (depending on whether it's a local file and whether the "Use entry's local directory..." box is checked.  [Save] the preset file.  If instead, the filename says "&lt;name&gt;.preset", then either the song is NOT actually PLAYING, you selected "EQF file" instead of "Preset file", or Fauxdacious was unable to determine a valid name, ie. from a really ugly URL.  In this case try cancelling the file dialog window, toggle the "Exclude arg. lists from URLs" checkbox, and try the Export again.  Once saved and activated, the [Preset(s)] button should light up indicating that Fauxdacious is using a custom preset file for this song entry.  Now, adjust the equalizer how you want it for this song, and check / uncheck any Effects plugins you want on / off for it (if "Save Effects..." checked), then repeat the [Save] step to re-save the custom preset file with new values as the custom presets for this entry.  When the entry stops playing and Fauxdacious advances to the next song entry, the equalizer settings and Effects plugins selections should return automatically to the defaults (what they were before you saved the custom file the first time and adjusted them).  The [Preset(s)] button's light / indicator should go off as well.  NOTE:  The song entry must be actually PLAYING when all this is being done!</span></td>

<td align="justify" valign="top" width="100%"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;font-size:19px;font-weight:normal;">If using the first way (FileWriter / Record), there are two additional plugin configuration options under stdout:  "close after song chg." and "close when recording stopped.".  They are useful when piping directly out to a stored file (as opposed to piping to another program downstream).  The first says to "close" (send an EOF, etc.) to stdout when the song changes (either by advancing to the next song entry or when title changes in a radio-station URL).  Use this when recording (dubbing) a song streaming stations, etc. as it will ensure a properly created song file of the LAST song recorded when recording is stopped (but any prev. song written out will be lost).  Unchecking ensures that everything written to stdout during the recording is included in the file produced by stdout as a single file.  However, stopping recording and starting a new recording will overwrite stdout with whatever's recorded by the second recording!  In order to create a continuous recording by stringing together everything from each recording (until Fauxdacious itself is stopped), uncheck the "close when recording stopped" box.  Also, uncheck both boxes if piping to another downstream program instead of a stored file.  Using the "-o/--out=&lt;ext&gt;" option will automatically toggle both these boxes off while piping, then reset them to their prev. values when Fauxdacious exits.  The tradeoff here though is that if both boxes are unchecked and you're piping to a stored file, the tag metadata from the first song is likely used for the file.</span></td>

<tr>
<td align="justify" valign="top" width="100%"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;font-size:19px;font-weight:normal;">Unlike Audacious, Fauxdacious can still save your custom tag data associated with song entries whether they support it or not.  Fauxdacious first tries to save the tag data in the song file itself, and failing that, can save it to a file, and read the metadata from that file whenever that song entry is played, as if the tag data were saved in the song entry file itself (NOTE:  These tags will not be present if playing in Audacious or another media player though)!  For most entries, the "Song Info." dialog will save the tag data in the common tag file:  "~/.config/fauxdacious[_instancename]/user_tag_data".  For disks (CDs and DVDs), it will be saved in a separate custom tag file "~/.config/fauxdacious[_instancename]/DISK-ID.tag.  For streams downloaded via youtube-dl through the helper-script (which expire and thus are considered "one-off" plays), a separate "tmp_tag_data" file is used.  CDs and DVDs also store tag data there while they are playing.  When playing an entry, Fauxdacious will look for tag data to fill in the metadata fields first in "~/.config/fauxdacious[_instancename]/tmp_tag_data", then (if song is a local file) in user_tag_data.tag in the directory the song file is in, then in "~/.config/fauxdacious[_instancename]/user_tag_data", then (if song is a CD/DVD track, in "~/.config/fauxdacious[_instancename]/DISK-ID.tag", and last, any tag data stored in the audio file itself.  These are all editable text files.  One of the argument fields for each tag is "Precedence" which can be set to "DEFAULT", "OVERRIDE", or "ONLY", which while processing the above tag sources, will either use as default, override any value from a previous source found, or ONLY use THAT value.  Another special field is the "Comment" field, which can be any text comment, but if set to the full path of a valid image file name, will be used as the "cover art image" for the song entry!  To turn these features on, go to [Settings].[Song Info] and check the "Save unsavable metadata to file" box.  If unchecked, then Fauxdacious will be limited to handling most metadata the same way Audacious does.  NOTE:  See also the "Allow Custom Tag-files" options under [Settings].[Plugins].[Audio Cd/DVD plugins] configurations for allowing these custom tag files for individual disks.</span></td>

If the stream also sets the Album field to the actual album name of the song being played, it will be prepended to the stream name in the Album field as:  "album name - stream name".  NOTE:  The URL helper that fetches Shoutcast stream urls places the station's website (in Reciva, Tunein, IHeart, etc.) in the Album field.  This will be overwritten by the Album info described above when a stream is played, when this checkbox is checked.  This was done because I believe the stream and album name is more useful being displayed than the station's original website URL.  NOTE2:  aac (libfaad) (v2.8.8-3.1+) seems to be busted (on Buster) and fails to play many (audio/aacp) streams so that for the time being, we have the ffaudio (ffmpeg) plugin grabbing these, but ffaudio doesn't yet dynamically update the metadata, so many streams may not have metadata (for the time being).</span></td>
