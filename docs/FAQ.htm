  <li><a href="#11">11) How do I set custom presets for an entire subdirectory of song files (the way XMMS can) / OR use a custom directory preset file that was created in XMMS?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#12">12) How do I pipe media, cue-sheets, playlists, etc. into Fauxdacious from stdin?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#13">13) How do I play media to stdout for post-processing instead of through my speakers?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#14">14) How do I get Fauxdacious to just mute but continue streaming whenever paused - I want to mute commercials in my streaming radio station and either toggle over to another Fauxdacious instance where I have my music ready to play a couple songs -or- play a video in my web-browser during the break?  If I "pause" the station playing commercials, it'll resume at the BEGINNING of the commercials, or the connection will be lost.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#15">15) How do I save tag metadata (ie. song title, artist, cover-art, etc.) using the [Song Info ...] dialog or manually for online streams, CDs, DVDs, and files in audio-formats that do not support the metadata tag format used by Audacious?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#16">16) When I start up Audacious from the command line with a list of stuff to play, Audacious often creates a new "playlist", which is very annoying since I use the WinAmp Skins interface and don't see the previous ones it created, which gets annoying since I end up with a bunch of old, one-off playlists before I realise it!  How do I start up Fauxdacious with just a single playlist, or even just with the files I specified on the command line?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#17">17) How do I start up Fauxdacious with the equalizer turned OFF?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#18">18) How do I start up Fauxdacious with "Recording" (dubbing) turned ON?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#19">19) How do I start up a second "instance" of Fauxdacious or one that uses a configuration different than my normal "default" configuration?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#20">20) How do I control different running Fauxdacious instances using the Fauxdtool?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#21">21) How do I get Fauxdacious to randomly change "skins" when the playlist entry changes (like the old XMMS "Random Skin on Play" option)?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#22">22) How do I use local lyrics files and lyrics from embedded tags in the Fauxdacious version of the lyrics plugin?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#23">23 - FIXED) Why do I get a bunch of "dbus errors" when exiting Fauxdacious when using the Qt interface (Audacious doesn't do this), is it serious?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#24">24) Audacious v4.0 has now made Qt the default and rumor has it that they may be dropping GTK support?  Is Fauxdacious going to follow suit?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#25">25) How do I reverse the sort order when clicking on the playlist column-headers in either of the "non-Winamp-skins" interfaces?  Audacious only sorts them in ascending order.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#26">26) What is Fauxdacious latest version#, and do you follow Audacious versioning?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#27">27) Audacious's display of Shoutcast streams' titles is sometimes ugly (ie. "artist: Artist, title: Title", etc.) and, at best displays both the artist and title in the Title field, but I want title in the Title field and artist in the Artist field (like the rest of my local music file collection), and put the stream name in the Album field instead.  Also, Audacious has recently added a "Split title into artist and title on chars" option in their lyrics plugin related to this, but I don't see that here.  How can I fix this?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#28">28) How can I get the albumart plugin to actually show the album-cover image for songs, especially for streaming radio-stations that change songs dynamically, that include metadata?  Audacious either doesn't show any cover art and Fauxdacious only shows the cover-art image for the streaming station itself, if anything at all.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#29">29) My global Fauxdacious "user_tag_data" tag file is getting large and cluttered with all the songs and streams for which I've saved cover-art icons and tag metadata for streaming stations and songs in formats that don't support metadata tags in the audio-file itself.  Is there a way I can have Fauxdacious save this data either in a "user_tag_data" file specific to a given album directory or perhaps in a tag-file associated with the specific song/stream, when I use the Fauxdacious [Song Info ...] metadata tag editor window?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#30">30) When recording a song from a streaming station, I want to save the metadata the station provides (and / or the album-cover image that the albumart plugin finds for it) while the song is recording - Audacious won't let me (since metadata can't be saved in a stream) and Fauxdacious will just overwrite the streaming station's name, etc. itself in the global "user_tag_data" file, so I have to edit it manually.  Is there an easier way?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#31">31) The Search Tool in Audacious now "monitors song file additions on my file-system and has also added a few cool new features which DON'T seem to be available in Fauxdacious.  How do I activate these in Fauxdacious?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#32">32) I use the Qt version of Audacious and love the new StreamTuner plugin for selecting IHeartRadio stations, but unlike your helper script that loads the station's icon and other info when adding an IHeartRadio station's website, there is no icon, genre, or title?  Audacious also clears my playlist and sets it to just the station I selected, but I just want to ADD stations to my current playlist!</a></li>
  <li><a href="#33">33) Most of my music is in formats, like mp3, ogg, etc. which contain embedded album-cover images in the file as Id3v24 tags.  Audacious supports displaying them, but NOT adding / changing them, so in Faudacious, the album art accumulates in the albumart directory on my hard drive and I have to keep a large "user_tag_data.tag" file full of references to these files!&nbsp;  Isn't there a better way?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#34">34) I like Audacious's Lyrics plugin for displaying song lyrics, but I have files with the lyrics already embedded in the tags, but the Lyrics plugin ignores them and still has to fetch them from the web.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#35">35) I need the Equalizer window to stay up after I exit and restart Audacious / Fauxdacious, but it doesn't, as I use the non-skinned interfaces.&nbsp;  Instead, I have to pop it back up manually.  Audacious has been asked to fix this, but hasn't yet, can you?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#36">36) What are these "helper scripts" you keep referencing and how do I install and get them working?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#37">37) Audacious's Lyrics plugins have become somewhat hobbled due to the lyricwiki site going defunct, can you do anything to fix this?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#38">38) My Album Art and / or Lyrics plugin is still not working!  What am I missing?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#39">39) Audacious now supports Qt on Windows, why doesn't Fauxdacious?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#40">40) How can I briefly override normal song-advance (next song, next shuffle, etc.) order in the currently-playing playlist to instead play one or more selected songs next?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#41">41) *NEW!* How can I add a new entry, then jump directly to it next?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#42">42) What is this "Mini-Fauxdacious" plugin under General Plugins (Audacious doesn't offer this)?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#43">43) How do I start Fauxdacious and load more than one playlist or split command-line entries into multiple playlists?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#44">44) What are these "channel" images that appear in addition to the Album-art plugin image displayed?</a></li>

Long-time Audacious users should find Fauxdacious an almost complete drop-in replacement for Audacious.  However, since it is now a completely separate program, Audacious users can install and try out Fauxdacious without any (known) risk to their existing Audacious installation or configuration.&nbsp;  If you wish to copy your existing Audacious configuration for starters (nearly all your settings will carry over seemlessly to Fauxdacious) in Fauxdacious, simply:</span></td>

<td align="justify" valign="top" width="100%"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;font-size:19px;font-weight:normal;">Fauxdacious has it's roots back around 2011 when I (the author) began experimenting with a few "hacks" to add some extra command-line options and tools to Audacious version 1.6 or so, which the Audacious team was not interested in including.&nbsp;  The real forkoff came in 2015 with Audacious v3.6 when I created a video-playing option for the ffmpeg plugin.&nbsp;  I felt that since Audacious included "visualization plugins" already, why not include one for actually displaying the video part of audio streams that contained video?&nbsp;  After much work to add video play, I submitted the patched plugin to Audacious as a patch, but the Audacious team made it clear that they were not interested in supporting / maintaining that feature.&nbsp;  They suggested using a video player such as VLC&nbsp;.  I, however, really like Audacious and it's audiophileish sound-improving effects plugins and Winamp Skins interface, much preferring Audacious to VLC, and preferred having a single "go-to" media player for playing all my media.&nbsp;  Therefore I decided to simply "fork" the code and maintain a separate Audacious branch that supported this along with it's growing list of feature patches, because I felt that other Audacious-lovers would also be interested in these new features.&nbsp;  I've also created new logos and and changed the branding to the new name "Fauxdacious".&nbsp;  I came up with this name by altering the name "Audacious" to have the French "Faux" like "Faux Pas" meaning "fake" or "not exactly the real thing" and liked the way it sounded!&nbsp;  It's pronounced either "Faw-d`&#230;-shuhs" (rhiming with Audacious) or "F&#333;-d`&#230;-shuhs".&nbsp;  I made the logo by using the basic "audacious" logo but adding a row of speakers instead of bubbles, a base ("F" cleff for the "F", and the slightly-rocked "X" from the default XMMS skin's logo in the lower right.&nbsp;  I made a separate logo for the Windows version replacing the rocked "X" with a rocked "MS-Windows flag logo" that contains a swirled "X".&nbsp;  The round icon replaces the "a" in a bubble with the aformentioned base-cleft "F".&nbsp;  NOTE:&nbsp;  I created this name and these logos and reserve all implied copyright rights to them as unique trademarks of "Fauxdacious"(tm).&nbsp;  They are not to be used for any other purpose without my explicit written permission.&nbsp;  The software code, a derived work, however is fully open-source" subject to the BSD license (the same license that Audacious uses) and you are free to use, modify and re-release your changes subject to those terms (so long as you change the name and logos).</span></td>

"youtube-dl" is a separate program that handles the actual "downloading" of the video.&nbsp;  In the case of Fauxdacious, the video is not actually downloaded to a file on your hard disk, but simply translated into a playable stream and metadata and a "cover-art" image is downloaded.&nbsp;  NOTE (2):&nbsp;  You will also need to go to [Settings].[Advanced], and add the full path and filename of the helper script you just copied over into the "URL-helper program?" field, and toogle the "Allow URL-helper:" dropdown to something other than "Never" ("Urls NOT in playlists" is reccomended except when you intend to load several Youtube-videos at once in a playlist, which can cause playlists with URLs to load VERY SLOWLY), and go to [Settings].[Song Info] and check the "Save unsavable metadata to file" box.

".m4a" usually works.&nbsp;  
If you moved and/or renamed the video file, you will need to move the saved video file to wherever you moved the saved video file and edit the user_tag_data.tag file, as the metadata saved is associated with the previous name and location.&nbsp;  NOTE:&nbsp;  The displayed "length" of the new video will be the same as the original, even if you only recorded part of it.&nbsp;  I have not figured out a way yet to correct the length for partial recordings.</span></td>

If the DVD menu doesn't seem to work (some DVDs just don't), you may want to check the "Only Longest Track in Playlist" box, which is usually just the main feature movie.&nbsp;  If none of the "Only..." boxes are checked, each "track" file on the DVD will appear in the playlist (giving it a cluttered appearance, and is not usually very useful).  

"Continue at end of menus" and "Skip Menus" should only be checked if a DVD's menus don't work otherwise, as this can cause some DVDs to crash Fauxdacious.&nbsp;  It's also helpful to have one or the other checked (experiment) if just playing audio (in which case there's no way for the user to interact with the DVD menus).

Check the box for [Allow Custom Tag-files] to allow usage of custom tag files which you can either create manually and/or use the save [Song Info ...] window to create and save metadata for the DVD tracks.&nbsp;  The custom tag file for a DVD will be "~/.config/fauxdacious[-instancename]/&lt;DVD_TITLE&gt;.tag".

NOTE:  This is also true for audio-CDs ("~/.config/fauxdacious[-instancename]/&lt;DISK-ID&gt;.tag"), except audio-CDs can also fetch metadata for individual tracks from freedb.com, or musicbrainz.com using the cover-art "helper" script (mentioned next paragraph below) and create the custom tag file (along with downloading any cover-art image) for you the first time you play the CD.

"instancename" can be any string of letters and digits up to 40 characters.&nbsp;  To create a completely "new" instance that you've never used before, just specify any name you choose, and Fauxdacious will create a brand new "~/.config/fauxdacious-&lt;instancename&gt;/" directory along with a factory-default "config" file.&nbsp;  If the directory already exists (Fauxdacious has been started before with this instance name), that configuration directory will be used.&nbsp;  This way, unlike in Audacious, you can have more than nine different configurations named to where you can remember what they're for!</span></td>

UPDATE:&nbsp;  As of v4.3-beta1 (Linux/Unix versions) hot-switching between GTK* and Qt are now fully supported the same way as in Audacious!&nbsp;  NOTE:&nbsp;  Not available in Windows version due to Qt not being supported for now (see above).&nbsp;  For maximum stability, even though not required, I personally recommend stopping playback before switching (I haven't stress-tested enough).&nbsp;  Either way, playback is stopped and must be manually be restarted with the [Play] button, though the cursor does remain on the same entry (as in Audacious).</span></td>
